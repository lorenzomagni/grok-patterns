# Grok Patterns (Linux, Windows, Fortinet Fortigate)
The Grok Patterns I wrote to parse Linux, Fortigate and Windows logs during my internship @ ICTeam

You may need to tweak and change them a little to serve your purpouse, but since I've noticed there are not many examples of working Grok Patterns on the internet, I hope these can be useful to someone.
